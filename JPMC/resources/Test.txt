TASK DESCRIPTIONAttention: Please follow these instructions super accurately. - Develop the solution yourself. Do not try to find a shortcut by   using the web. - Whilst the preference for the test is to use Java using maven as build tool,   you may use any programming language you like. - If another language other than Java is used, please provide instructions    on how to build the project, the versions used and the instructions on how to run the program. - The core of the solution should be written without any add-ons to   the core of the programming language. Use only the defined language   standard (e.g. you can use all features that you find in a standard Sun JDK).   This means that you can use external libraries, but your program   should still produce the wanted solutions after removing those   parts. For example, if you would decide to use a logging library   then your program would still work correctly after removing all   parts that use the logging library. You can also use JUnit (or equivalent test library). - Optimize for speed of development and quality of development. Do   not optimize for runtime execution speed. The problem is small and   you can afford to waste a few milli seconds. It is better to focus   on getting a working solution faster. - Deliver your result in the best professional quality you can   produce. Polish your solution. Make a master piece out of it.  It   is part of this task to compare what different people consider to   be a professional quality solution. - The program should not take long to solve the problem in terms of computing power.First read through the whole of it in order to get an overview.Concentrate on the details only upon second reading.Please be aware that reviewing the code submitted, we will be looking for Clean Code as specified in the book “Clean Code: A Hanbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship” by Robert C Martin.PROBLEM 1By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.   3                      3  7 4                    7 - 2 4 6                  - 4 -8 5 9 3                - - 9 -That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:7595 6417 47 8218 35 87 1020 04 82 47 6519 01 23 75 03 3488 02 77 73 07 63 6799 65 04 28 06 16 70 9241 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 3341 48 72 33 47 32 37 16 94 2953 71 44 65 25 43 91 52 97 51 1470 11 33 28 77 73 17 78 39 68 17 5791 71 52 38 17 14 91 43 58 50 27 29 4863 66 04 68 89 53 67 30 73 16 69 87 40 3104 62 98 27 23 09 70 98 73 93 38 53 60 04 23PROBLEM 2As an investment bank we have a requirement to maintain the total quantity of a traded security held at any point in time, this is referred to as a real time position.A position is stored at an aggregated level using the trading account and security identifier.Creation of a position is driven by an incoming Trade Event stream. Each event contains the key attributes required to create the position:  - Trade ID – Identifier for the trade, sequential number - Trade Version – Version of the trade, sequential number - Security Identifier – Traded security, string - Quantity – Number of shares in the current trade, number - Direction – Buy or Sell indicator - Account Number – Account used to purchase shares, string - Operation – NEW/AMEND/CANCELPositioning Rules1. Each unique Account + Security Identifier combination creates one aggregate position record that contains multiple trade events.2. The position quantity will be incremented when a trade is processed with the following attributes:  a. Direction = BUY, Operation = NEW or AMEND  b. Direction = SELL, Operation = CANCEL3. The position quantity will be decremented when a trade is processed with the following attributes:  a. Direction = SELL, Operation = NEW or AMEND  b. Direction = BUY, Operation = CANCEL4.    Multiple versions of a trade with the same trade ID can be processed, however, only the trade with the highest version should remain part of the aggregated position record.Lifecycle example - assume the same account and security identifier. In the input set the account, direction, operation and security identifier can change between versions.Trade ID     Version    Operation    Quantity    Outcome1            1          NEW          100         Process the NEW trade. Result = 1001            2          AMEND        150         Reverse the previous NEW trade. Process the AMEND trade. Result = 1501            3          AMEND        200         Reverse the previous AMEND trade. Process the AMEND trade. Result = 200.1            4          CANCEL       N/A         Reverse the previous AMEND. Result = 0Trade events can arrive in any order. Once the solution is completed for sequentially incrementing IDs and versions in the below input data. InputTrade ID|Version|Security Identifier|Quantity|Direction|Account|Operation1234|1|XYZ|100|BUY|ACC-1234|NEW1234|2|XYZ|150|BUY|ACC-1234|AMEND5678|1|QED|200|BUY|ACC-2345|NEW5678|2|QED|0|BUY|ACC-2345|CANCEL2233|1|RET|100|SELL|ACC-3456|NEW2233|2|RET|400|SELL|ACC-3456|AMEND2233|3|RET|0|SELL|ACC-3456|CANCEL8896|1|YUI|300|BUY|ACC-4567|NEW6638|1|YUI|100|SELL|ACC-4567|NEW6363|1|HJK|200|BUY|ACC-5678|NEW7666|1|HJK|200|BUY|ACC-5678|NEW6363|2|HJK|100|BUY|ACC-5678|AMEND7666|2|HJK|50|SELL|ACC-5678|AMEND8686|1|FVB|100|BUY|ACC-6789|NEW8686|2|GBN|100|BUY|ACC-6789|AMEND9654|1|FVB|200|BUY|ACC-6789|NEW1025|1|JKL|100|BUY|ACC-7789|NEW1036|1|JKL|100|BUY|ACC-7789|NEW1025|2|JKL|100|SELL|ACC-8877|AMEND1122|1|KLO|100|BUY|ACC-9045|NEW1122|2|HJK|100|SELL|ACC-9045|AMEND1122|3|KLO|100|SELL|ACC-9045|AMEND1144|1|KLO|300|BUY|ACC-9045|NEW1144|2|KLO|400|BUY|ACC-9045|AMEND1155|1|KLO|600|SELL|ACC-9045|NEW1155|2|KLO|0|BUY|ACC-9045|CANCELOutputAccount|Instrument|Quantity|TradesACC-1234|XYZ|150|1234ACC-2345|QED|0|5678ACC-3456|RET|0|2233ACC-4567|YUI|200|8896,6638ACC-5678|HJK|50|6363,7666ACC-6789|GBN|100|8686ACC-6789|FVB|200|9654,8686ACC-7789|JKL|100|1036,1025ACC-8877|JKL|-100|1025ACC-9045|KLO|300|1122,1144,1155ACC-9045|HJK|0|1122
